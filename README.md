# projectEuler
Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/about) allows me to combine my passion for mathematics and computing science by challenging me to solve these problems (https://projecteuler.net/archives). This repository contains complete and incomplete solutions of the problems and will be completed in multiple programming languages. Doing this project allows me to exercise my programming as I am forgetful, while helping me reinforce my mathematical skills.
