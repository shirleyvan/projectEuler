# projectEuler
projectEuler contains my progression in using mathematics and computing science to solve problems from Project Euler. Initially meant as an exercise to brush up my Python and logical process, I began working on Project Euler problems on the side to keep challenging myself in both disciplines.

This repository contains complete and incomplete solutions of the problems and will be hopefully completed in multiple programming languages.
